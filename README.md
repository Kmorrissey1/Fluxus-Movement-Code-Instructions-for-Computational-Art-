# Fluxus-Movement-Code-Instructions-for-Computational-Art-
In the tradition of the Fluxus movement, in which instructions play a key role, I intended to make transparent the written, plain English instructions which guide the creation of computational art!

![judgey ducky](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d213014e-0c1f-42ea-a7d1-6a71cc14a2a2)

Intended output: A yellow, cartoon duck in a powerful stance against a purple background,  glaring at the viewer with a judgmental expression. A text box is near his head, which states what he is doingâ€“scanning your vibe!
 
Library used: P5.js

Goals/influences: I was inspired by animated shorts I frequently see on social media. Lots of creatives make adorable, sassy characters, and there is a social media trend of cute animals "checking your vibe" as you scroll. It is often meant to be taken as a fun, positive break from doomscrolling. I also have some personal lore with stuffed animals with loved ones. One of my stuffed animals (definitely NOT influenced by my actions!) gets in a loved one's space to playfully assess their vibes. 
	
Feedback: A peer of mine wrote what he thought the instructions would be upon seeing the visual output, and assessed the efficacy of the code based on intended outcomes. You can check it out under feedback.md


Instruction: 

1.Set up the canvas

2.Create the background (P5.JS conventions so far!)

3.Draw the shadow for the duck 

4.Draw the duck's body using circles

5.Draw the duck head using circles

6.Draw the eye 

7.Draw the eye highlight

8.Draw the beak

9.Draw the judgmental eyebrow

10.Draw the feet far apart

11.Draw the legs to connect feet to body

12.Make the text box

13.Write out the text

14. Add missing details!
