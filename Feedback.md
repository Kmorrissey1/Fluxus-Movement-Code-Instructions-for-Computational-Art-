Sketch/image description:
A cute duck in a dynamic pose against a purple background sporting a very judgmental facial expression, accompanied by the text: “Duck judge is scanning your vibe…”

Breaking the code into written steps:
1.	Set up the canvas 
2.	Create the background (set color to purple) 
3.	Draw the shadow for the duck (ellipse shape, color and opacity)
4.	Draw the duck body (ellipse shape and color)
5.	Draw the duck head (circle shapes and color)
6.	Draw the eye (circle shape and color)
7.	Draw the eye highlight (circle shape and color)
8.	Draw the beak  (custom shape and color)
9.	Draw the eyebrow (strokes) 
10.	Draw the feet (custom shape and color)
11.	Draw the legs (strokes)
12.	Draw the text box (box shape)
13.	Draw the text (Duck Judge is scanning your vibe) 
14.	Draw more shadows (custom shapes and opacity)

Code review:
Looking at how you approached the code, it makes total sense! I don’t think I would have approached it any differently to be honest. I am very impressed with how you managed to use the translation values to get things placed as tightly as you did.
I like how you thought about this from the base layer up, and I think your code reads really organized because of it. I really wouldn’t change anything, maybe if there was more time, I would have experimented with adding gradients for even more depth? 

I think it’s a really cool, little piece! I normally don’t like being judged, but I’ll gladly make an exception for this little critter.
